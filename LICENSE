LICENSE:

Reva is dedicated by the author, Ron Aaron, to the Public Domain.   In the event
your country does not recognize my ability to so dedicate it, I also grant
unconditional, non-revocable permission to anyone who obtains a copy of this
software, to use, modify and to redistribute it without limitation.

That means: you may use Reva however you like, for commercial or non-commercial
uses.  You may charge money for it.  You may modify it as much as you like.
Nevertheless, I would appreciate your giving credit if you find it useful in
your projects or products by providing my contact information and credit as the
original author.

Reva is provided "AS IS", with no warranty of any kind.  It may or may not work
as you would like, and might even damage your computer or data.  Still, it
pleases me to provide it anyway.  Since it is produced in my spare time, and
since you don't have to pay for it, that seems reasonable.
