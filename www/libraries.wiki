<title>Libraries</title>

A "library" in Reva is a specially-named file containing Reva code, located in a particular place.  It may contain any Reva code whatsoever; however, the libraries provided by Reva are grouped according to function.

To begin with, almost all Reva libraries are in subdirectories of the "lib" directory (next to the "bin" directory, just off the topmost Reva directory).  For example, the library "lib/math/doubles" contains code for doing double-cell math.

<h2>Using libraries</h2>

In order to use a library, you simply "need" it.  For example:

<pre>
needs math/doubles
</pre>

will cause Reva to load the file in "lib/math/doubles".  Now every word defined in that library is available to you.  

If you want to know what words are defined in a library, you can of course load that library file in your favorite text-editor.  However, that can be confusing; so for the majority of libraries, simply asking for help on the library is illuminating:

<pre>
help math/doubles
</pre>

You may also get help on what libraries are available:

<pre>
help libraries
</pre>

Or, you can see what libraries have been "need"ed already:

<pre>
.needs
</pre>
