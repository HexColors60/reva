	Get the next random number.

	The generate always starts from a known place, so sequences will be
	generated identically.  To get more 'random' behavior, use 'randomize' after
	loading the library.

def: rnd-seed
stack: n -- 
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Use the value 'n' as the 'seed' for the random generator

def: randomize
stack: --
ctx: ~
desc: =
	Initialize the random number generator based on the time.
